<h1> Speedrun.com App </h1>

So, first I bet you're wondering "Why did you make this?". Well, the app for Android on Google Play was missing a few features and
I wanted to brush up on JSON parsing and ListViews. Utilizes Picasso for image loading into the imageviews rather than filecaching each image into a temporary folder.

That being said this app allows the user to search a particular game and look at it's leaderboards. When a particular run is clicked, it
will launch it's respective app (youtube, twitch, or whatever else the video link sends the user to). I am aware there is plenty more data
to include in this app such as platform the game was run on, but this was more of a practice project than a complete app for users in mind.
